# Move Lint
A static detection tool for Move language. The tool takes a smart contract as input and can automatically discover potential security vulnerabilities in the contract, locate the codes which generate the vulnerabilities, and enhance the security of the contract.   

The tool mainly includes two types of detection:
1. Code conventions detection. It detects any violations of certain code conventions during the development of a smart contract. The possibility of introducing security vulnerabilities is greatly increased by inappropriate code writing.
2. Regular security issues detection. It detects regular security issues in the contracts. Regular security issues are issues that may exist in any contract and are independent of business logic, e.g. division before multiplication.

The tool has a [detection rule library](src/lint/detectors/README.md), providing convenient addition and deletion interfaces. It can quickly adapt to new detection rules and improve its detection abilities as the business development of the Move smart contracts.
